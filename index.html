      <h1>Vito Saccomandi</h1>
      <p><em>PhD Student in Political Philosophy and Critical Theory</em></p>

      <p>
        I am a social and political philosopher interested in social critique,
        the study of authoritarianism and the extreme right, and the philosophy of work.
        I am currently a doctoral researcher in Philosophy at Sapienza University of Rome,
        where my work is supervised by Prof. Marcello Mustè, Prof. Giorgio Fazio,
        and Prof. Maria Chiara Giorgi.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work engages with social critique, the study of authoritarianism and the extreme right,
        and the philosophy of work. I draw on a broad range of sources, including critical theory,
        Marxist and post-Marxist debates, social and political philosophy, and contemporary social theory.
      </p>

      <p>
        My doctoral research focuses on Karl Korsch and examines the problem of socialization,
        economic planning, and the Marxist theory of the state. In particular, I aim to reinterpret
        the concept of socialization within a holistic framework for the study of society, connecting
        Korsch’s insights to contemporary discussions and to the proposals advanced by social movements
        for global justice over the past fifteen years, in order to formulate a renewed, normative
        account of socialization as a practice of collective self-determination.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also undertake journalistic investigative work, collaborating with magazines such as
        <em>MicroMega</em> and with independent radio stations including Radio Onda Rossa and
        Radio Onda d’Urto. In this context, my focus lies on mapping and analysing the contemporary
        far right in Italy and Europe, with particular attention to its cultural foundations,
        hegemonic strategies, and the evolving ideological trajectories of right-wing populist movements.
        I completed my MA in Philosophy at Sapienza University of Rome, where I wrote a thesis titled
        <em>Il metodo dell’esposizione dialettica di Max Horkheimer e la possibilità di una teoria critica della società</em>.
        The dissertation was developed during a research stay at the Humboldt University of Berlin,
        where I worked on early Critical Theory and its methodological foundations.
